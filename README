# Performance_Programming_CW

## Introduction

This directory contains a simple molecular dynamics (MD) code

The program implements:

    long range inverse square forces between particles. F = G * m1*m2 / r**2
    viscosity term     F = -u V

If 2 particles approach closer than Size we flip the direction of the
interaction force to approximate a collision.

Coordinates are relative to a large central mass and the entire system is moving relative to the viscous media.

This program was developed as part of a code optimisation course
and is therefore deliberately inefficient.

The code is available in C and Fortran. You only need to work with one version 
of the code.

The program reads input.dat and writes output.dat.

The directory Test contains source of a program to compare output.dat files.
It will only report differences above a preset tolerance value.

## How to Compile and Run the code on Cirrus

- Log into Cirrus

- Follow this path to access to the final code version: B155696_PP_CW_Code -> Final_Version

- Go to the C directory

- ```
  module load inetl-compilers-18
  ```

- Compile the code using ICC

  ```
  make
  ```

- Run the code on the login node

  ```
  ./MD
  ```

- Run the code on the compute node

  ```
  cd ..
  qsub bench_c.pbs
  ```

- Test for correctness

  ```
  cd C
  ./auto_test.sh
  ```
